# Asset-Allocation-Financial-Model-VS-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
In this research, we evaluated the effectiveness of ten asset allocation algorithms, including traditional Markowitz-based methods (Tangency Portfolio, Minimum Variance Portfolio, Risk Parity, Equal Weight, Hierarchical Risk Parity) and advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDPG, SAC, TD3).
